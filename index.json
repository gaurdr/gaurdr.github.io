[{"content":"Undergraduate Research assistantships in Optimization Research Group, Lethbridge\nThree research assistantships are available immediately for qualified undergraduate students in CS and related disciplines. You will work on international collaborative projects with partners from the UK, Croatia and the Netherlands funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC.\nQuantum Approaches for Electric Grid Operations (1 position) The project is on quantum approaches for Electrical Grid operations and is led by Drs. Robert Benkoczi and Daya Gaur.\nThe pay for a research position is very competitive ($20/hour), and the time commitment is 10 to 12 hours weekly for one year. You will be able to take courses concurrently. Accommodations such as flexitime are possible if needed.\nIf you are interested in algorithms and quantum computation, are comfortable with programming in python and are an independent learner, this position is for you. You will read papers on the formulations of power-flow equations and algorithms for solving them. Knowledge of quantum algorithms for equation solving (HHL) would be an asset but not required. Prior experience with Qiskit would be valuable. If you do not have expertise in Qiskit, Quantum Algorithms still apply, as there will be opportunities to learn from experts during the research assistantship. You will also get to meet and interact with members of the Optimization Research Group in weekly meetings.\nTo apply, send a cover letter and a copy of your current CV to Professor Robert Benkoczi (robert.benkoczi@uleth.ca). The cover letter should address why you think you are the right candidate for the position and what you hope to gain from this research experience. Feel free to email Dr. Robert Benkoczi at robert.benkoczi@ulet.ca if you have any questions.\nAlgorithms for Hypergraph decompositions and Constraint Satisfaction (2 positions) Two research assistantships are available immediately for qualified undergraduate students in CS and related disciplines. You will work on an international collaborative project (UK) funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC.\nThe pay for a research position is very competitive (\u0026gt;20$ per hour), and the time commitment is 10 to 12 hours weekly for six months. You will be able to take courses concurrently. Accommodations such as flexitime are possible if needed. If you are interested in algorithms, are comfortable with programming and are an independent learner, this position is for you. You will gain invaluable research experience. You will read papers on algorithms for constraint satisfaction and hypergraph decompositions. Your primary responsibility would be the empirical evaluation of some known algorithms. There will be the opportunity to participate in the development of new algorithms as well. Prior experience with Python/Julia would be valuable. If you do not have expertise in Algorithms, still apply, as there will be opportunities to learn from experts during the research assistantship. You will also get to meet and interact with members of the Optimization Research Group in weekly meetings and with international collaborators semi-regularly.\nPlease apply by sending a cover letter and a copy of your current CV to Professor Daya Gaur, gaur@cs.uleth.ca. The cover letter should address why you think you are the right candidate for the position and what you hope to gain from this research experience.\nExcellence in research requires Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in all aspects of research. We are committed to upholding those values by fostering creative and collaborative intellectual inquiry by bringing diverse knowledge, experiences, and perspectives to research projects.\n","permalink":"https://gaurdr.github.io/news/ugrad-positions/","summary":"Undergraduate Research assistantships in Optimization Research Group, Lethbridge\nThree research assistantships are available immediately for qualified undergraduate students in CS and related disciplines.
